<div class="terms-content">
	
<p>
	Welcome to Nemabollon , a Michigan benefit corporation (together with its affiliates, officers, directors, agents, employees, representatives, partners and their respective affiliates, collectively,  Nemabollon"). This Terms of Use ("Agreement") is a contract between you ("you") and Nemabollon and governs your access and use of the Nemabollon.org website and all other websites owned and operated by Nemabollon that have this Agreement posted (collectively, the "Website"), including, but not limited to, all transactions conducted on the Website and all Nemabollon services provided in connection with the Website. By accessing or using the Website, you signify that you have read all of the terms and conditions in, and linked to, this Agreement (including the Privacy Policy), and you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether or not you participate in Nemabollon's microlending program or related programs, services or activities (collectively, the "Program") or otherwise access or use the Website (in each such capacity, a "User"). If you do not agree with all of the terms and conditions in this Agreement, please do not participate in the Program or access or use the Website.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
Welcome to Nemabollon! You’re legally agreeing to the terms on this page when you visit and use Nemabollon’s website. So you should read them. This column can help you navigate the major points in the terms.
</p>

<p>
If you don’t agree with these terms, you shouldn’t use Nemabollon’s website.
</p>

<p>
This Agreement supersedes any previous agreement to which you and Nemabollon may have been bound (provided that if you are a Borrower, Trustee, Field Partner or Lender who has a separate written agreement with Nemabollon, the terms of that separate agreement will control with respect to any provision that conflicts with this Agreement). This Agreement may be modified by Nemabollon in its sole discretion from time to time and such modifications shall automatically become part of this Agreement and shall be effective once posted by Nemabollon on the Website (as indicated by the posted update date). Your participation in the Program and use of the Website will be subject to any such modifications. You should review the Website and this Agreement from time to time for any modifications. If you do not agree with any such modifications, please immediately terminate your registered Nemabollon account, if any, as outlined in Section 8 below, and please immediately stop participating in the Program and accessing and using the Website.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
The Terms of Use is the current agreement between you and Nemabollon. If you have any other contracts with Nemabollon (for example if you are a Nemabollon borrower or a investment matching sponsor), those may override certain things in this Terms of Use.
 Nemabollon may make changes to this agreement at any time. When we do, you’ll know we’ve updated it by looking at the date at the top of the page.
</p>

<p>

This Agreement is divided into the following sections:
<ul>
<li >1. Participation in the Program</li>
<li>2. Additional Website Features</li>
<li>3. Acceptable Use</li>
<li>4. Proprietary Rights</li>
<li>5. Disclaimers; Limitation of Liability</li>
<li>6. Governing Law; Resolution of Disputes; Arbitration and Waivers</li>
<li>7. Indemnity</li>
<li>8. Term; Termination</li> 
<li>9. Entire Agreement; Severability; Assignment</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p>
1. Participation in the Program Nemabollon manages the Website, which matches you and other persons (each, a "Lender" and, collectively, "Lenders") with borrowers and social enterprises in various countries in need of affordable capital (each, a "Borrowers" and, collectively, "Borrowers"). In most instances, these Borrowers are considered "high risk" by traditional lenders for a variety of factors, including, but not limited to, the Borrowers' lack of credit history, the use of the investment proceeds for entrepreneurial endeavors including investment in a "start up" business, and the geographic location including the risk of financial instability and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Please carefully review the Website section entitled "The risks of lending" which highlights the various risks associated with lending online through Nemabollon and explains in greater detail the role played by Nemabollon and its Field Partners and Trustees (each defined below in this Section 1).
</p>

<p>

Basically,
This section describes what Nemabollon does. Lending on Nemabollon is risky and you might not get repaid what you lend. Please read our page called “The risks of lending” for more information on the different types of risk you assume when you make a investment.
</p>

<p>
You may participate in the Program as a Lender by creating an online account on the Website registered to your email address. All transactions between Lenders and Borrowers or Field Partners must be conducted through a Nemabollon account - technically speaking, Nemabollon may, in certain circumstances, be considered the “lender” on your behalf when you make investments on the Website. The amount of funds you have available in your Nemabollon account that you have deposited – whether from your personal funds or value from a Nemabollon Card (as defined below in Section 2.4) – and is freely available to be lent is referred to as your  Nemabollon Credit." If you make a investment (as defined in the next sentence) through the Website, you are instructing Nemabollon to apply your Nemabollon Credit to fund the specific investment you have designated on the Website. All Nemabollon Credit in your Nemabollon account must be lent and repaid to your account before you can withdraw it, and you must have a PayPal account to withdraw funds from Nemabollon’s system.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
You have to create an account to lend on Nemabollon. Money in your account is called  Nemabollon credit” and it can be used to make investments on Nemabollon. You can’t withdraw money from your account until it’s been lent out to a borrower and repaid to your account. You need to have a valid bank account. The payments will be made out in USD. Any of the following cards is valid for use on the website for transactions. 
<%= image_tag("paymentIcons.png", :alt => "icon", width: "100", height: "100") %>
</p>

<p>
By participating in the Program or otherwise accessing or using the Website, you hereby acknowledge and agree that (a) Nemabollon makes no representation, warranty, covenant or guarantee that any funds you lend to a Borrower via the Website will be repaid in whole or in part, (b) investments and other similar transactions made via the Website (each, a  investment") are unsecured and bear a high risk of non-repayment and (c) given your financial situation and objectives, you will lend only those amounts on the Website that you can afford to lose. investments made via the Website are philanthropic in nature with no offered rate of return and, as such, are not intended as, and cannot be considered as, an investment in a financial instrument or security. investments made via the Website are not cancellable or refundable by the User.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
Again, lending on Nemabollon is risky! That means you should only lend money that you can afford to lose. Once you’ve made a investment, you can’t cancel it, and Nemabollon doesn’t guarantee that it will be repaid. You also won’t earn interest on Nemabollon investments.
 Nemabollon will hold amounts due and payable to Lenders, Field Partners and Borrowers (including Nemabollon Credit) separate from Nemabollon’s general funds, in a deposit account established to hold funds for the benefit of Users with funds in the Nemabollon system (“User Funds Account”). Nemabollon will not use such amounts for Nemabollon’s general operating expenses; however, Nemabollon reserves the right to retain (a) interest on funds while such funds are held in a User Funds Account and (b) any foreign exchange gains collected in connection with investment repayments, and to use such interest and gains in support of Nemabollon’s general operating expenses.
</p>

<p>
Basically, Nemabollon raises money for our operations separate from investments. This means we won’t use the money in your Nemabollon account to run our organization (unless you decide to donate it to us).
</p>


<h4 style="text-align:center;"> TYPES OF INVESTMENTS ON THE WEBSITE </h4>

<p>

a.        Partner investments. The majority of investments on the Website are administered by existing domestic and international organizations (each, a "Field Partner" and, collectively, "Field Partners") that work in underbanked or low-income communities and generally have a stated mission to reduce poverty by providing affordable working capital, services or supplies to underbanked or low-income borrowers (“Partner investments”). When a Partner investment is fully funded, Nemabollon sends Lender funds to the Field Partner administering the Partner investment, and receives Borrower repayments via the Field Partner as the investment is repaid.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
Most investments on Nemabollon’s website are posted by third-party organizations we call “Field Partners.” Field Partners disburse money to borrowers and collect repayments, which they then send to Nemabollon.
</p>

<p>
b.         Direct investments. Certain other investments on the Website are not administered by Field Partners, but instead are made by transferring funds directly from a Lender’s Nemabollon account to a Borrower’s digital account (“Direct investments”). Because Direct investments are not managed by a Field Partner, they typically bear a greater risk of non-repayment than most Partner investments. As Direct investments are repaid, funds are then transferred directly from the Borrower’s account back to Lenders’ Nemabollon accounts. Some, but not all, Direct investments are endorsed by individuals or institutions that vouch for the Borrower’s character (“Trustees”). Trustees may help manage their respective Borrowers’ relationships with Nemabollon, but Trustees do not handle investment disbursements or repayments made through Nemabollon’s system, and they do not guarantee Borrower repayments. Prior to June 1, 2016, Direct investments were administered through a separate Nemabollon-operated website known as  Nemabollon Zip.” Direct investments and Partner investments differ in some important ways, which will be explained more below.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
A few investments on Nemabollon’s website are posted and managed by Nemabollon without any assistance from a Field Partner – we call these “direct investments.” In general, direct investments have a higher risk of non-repayment than Field Partner investments because there’s no third-party managing the investment. Some direct investments are endorsed by “Trustees,” which are people or institutions that vouch for the borrower’s character but do not actually handle the investment.
</p>


<h4 style="text-align:center;"> INVESTMENT DISBURSEMENT</h4>

<p>

a.         Partner investment Disbursement. Partner investments are not made directly to Borrowers, but are instead administered by Field Partners. investment requests are posted in cooperation with such Field Partners and are, before being listed on Nemabollon, converted to U.S. dollar amounts as necessary and then rounded up to the nearest U.S. dollar increment of 25, to help streamline the investment transaction process. Funds investmented by you, the Lender, will be delivered to Field Partners for ultimate disbursement to, or backfilling of investments to, the Borrower(s) you have selected. In certain cases, Borrowers may receive goods and services funded by investment amounts, such as agricultural packages, from Field Partners, instead of the monetary amount of the investment. A Field Partner may voluntarily choose to pre-fund your Borrower in the short-term from its own funds in anticipation of receiving your investment amounts as backfill. This helps reduce the time the Borrower needs to wait until the investment is funded on the Website and the funds are delivered to the Field Partner. Nemabollon serves as a middle-man in the process and aggregates funds from multiple Lenders via the Website and delivers 100% of these funds on a net billing basis (excluding the interest earned, if any, on such funds while they are held in a User Funds Account, which interest is contributed toward funding Nemabollon's operations) to the Field Partner(s) for disbursement to the Borrowers selected by Lenders for funding on the Website. Please note that many Field Partners require mandatory savings as part of their transaction process to serve as collateral, which savings may help ensure that Borrowers are able to accumulate cash and represent a good risk. In certain cases, mandatory savings (and fees) are netted by Field Partners against the investments forwarded by Nemabollon.
</p>

<p>
The process of disbursement to a Borrower in a particular country, however, may vary from the standard disbursement structure just described. Currency and other national or local regulations may require a different philanthropic funding structure in some countries. In such cases, instead of investment funds being forwarded directly to the corresponding Field Partner, Nemabollon may, for example, have to transact with other intermediaries (such as the Field Partner's U.S.-based affiliates or other third parties licensed in the particular country to transact in foreign currencies) to structure a different indirect funding process that enables a Borrower to ultimately be supported by a Partner investment from you. In some cases, Nemabollon may approve a Field Partner’s pledge of collateral to another lender that may include investments supported by Nemabollon Users.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
This section explains how we get your money to borrowers. Most investments are distributed to borrowers through Nemabollon’s Field Partners. Nemabollon works with lots of different types of Field Partners and borrowers in different countries, so the process of investment distribution can vary depending on the investment.
</p>

<p>
Field Partners are solely responsible for screening and selecting each Borrower (including, without limitation, posting requests for Partner investments on the Website) and making all Partner investment disbursements, and Nemabollon expressly disclaims any responsibility to screen or select any Borrower or any Field Partner or monitor the disbursement of investment proceeds from the Field Partner(s) to the Borrower(s). Nemabollon and its Field Partners shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to such screening or selection of Borrowers or Field Partners and the disbursement of investment proceeds from the Field Partner(s) to the Borrower(s), and you shall hold Nemabollon and its Field Partners harmless from any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from such screenings, selections and disbursements.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
For partner investments, Nemabollon doesn’t choose the individual borrowers posted to our website by Field Partners. Neither Nemabollon nor our Field Partners will be liable to you should problems arise with Field Partners, borrowers or the investment disbursement process.
</p>

<p>
b.         Direct investment Disbursement. Direct investments are made directly to Borrowers, without facilitation by Field Partners. Direct investment requests are submitted by Borrowers and approved by Nemabollon before they are posted to the Website. Funds investmented by you, the Lender, will be transferred directly to the account of the Borrower you have chosen to support. Nemabollon serves as a middle-man in the process and aggregates funds from multiple Lenders via the Website and delivers 100% of these funds (excluding the interest earned, if any, on such funds while they are held in a User Funds Account, which interest is contributed toward funding Nemabollon's operations) to the Borrower. Nemabollon expressly disclaims any responsibility to screen Trustees or Borrowers or monitor Borrowers’ use of Nemabollon funds. Nemabollon and the Trustees shall have no liability whatsoever with respect to such screening or selection of Borrowers, and you shall hold Nemabollon and the Trustees harmless from any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from such screening and selection of Borrowers.
</p>

<p>
Basically, Nemabollon does select borrowers who receive a direct investment and sends them the money without help from a Field Partner. Neither Nemabollon, nor anyone who endorses a direct investment, will be liable to you if any problems arise with these borrowers.
</p>

<p>
1.3       Investment Collection and Repayment. Partner investments are repaid by Borrowers to the Field Partners. Generally, as a Borrower repays a investment, the respective Field Partner will post a record to the Website of such repayments actually received by the Field Partner, and it is the responsibility and obligation of the applicable Field Partner to pay over such collected investment payments to Nemabollon. In some cases (for example, for investments in India), the records of repayments are not posted on the Website as the Borrowers repay the investments, as a result of certain system and country regulatory constraints. Direct investments are repaid directly by Borrowers to Lenders, without facilitation by a Field Partner. Repayments may be made in periodic installments, depending on the terms of the applicable investment. In some cases (for example, for investments in India), repayments may only be provided at the end of a fixed term (for example, after 43 months), as a result of certain system and country regulatory constraints. Except as may be provided in Section 1.4 ("Principal Loss Scenarios"), Section 2.2 (“Dedicate a investment Feature”), Section 2.3 ("Promotional Products"), Section 2.5 (“Free Trial and Bonus Features”) and Section 2.6 (“Donor Advised Fund”) below, any amounts actually received by Nemabollon (whether directly from a Borrower or from a Field Partner as repayment by an applicable Borrower) will be distributed among the Lenders on a pro rata basis in accordance with the amounts investmented by such Lenders to such Borrower(s). These distributions may, in Nemabollon's sole discretion, be made periodically or in one lump sum once 100% of all investment proceeds for a particular investment have been received by Nemabollon. Furthermore, please note that timing of distributions to Lenders of any collected repayment may vary and may be materially impacted because of circumstances that, in Nemabollon's judgment, require Nemabollon to conduct further reviews with respect to the collected repayments (for example, to resolve issues regarding accuracy of repayment amounts and corresponding data, or for other issues). If, for any reason, a given Field Partner is unable to collect Partner investment repayments directly from the Borrower(s) or if Nemabollon, for any reason, is unable to collect investment repayments directly from a Field Partner or a Borrower, repayment of your investment amounts could be at risk of partial or total delay or non-repayment and a loss of some or all of your principal could occur. You hereby acknowledge and agree that neither Field Partners nor Borrowers will have direct contractual obligation or liability to pay you any principal and that Nemabollon is obligated to repay only such investment principal to the extent actually received by Nemabollon from a Field Partner or a Borrower (subject to the conditions noted above). None of Nemabollon, its Field Partners or any Borrower will have any obligation to pay interest on the investment or other fees or amounts (other than as expressly set forth above) to you or any other Lender in connection with any investment you make. At this time, Nemabollon does not charge interest on any investments posted on the Website. However, you should note that in the case of Partner investments, Field Partners charge interest and fees to Borrowers to, for example, cover their operational expenses.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
This section explains how investment repayment works. After we receive a repayment on one of your investments, we return the money to you and the other lenders in proportion to how much everyone lent. If a borrower or Field Partner doesn’t send repayments to Nemabollon as expected, you won’t get your money back. You don’t have the right to seek repayments directly from Field Partners or borrowers.
</p>

<p>
1.4       Principal Loss Scenarios. Nemabollon will generally deem a investment to be in default if Nemabollon determines that collection of funds for such investment is doubtful or the cumulative amount repaid as of a quarterly reconciliation is less than the amount expected as of six (6) months prior, although case by case differences may exist based on pending prospects for repayment of the investment and depending on country context and related system and regulatory constraints. You understand and hereby consent (without any prior notice thereof) to any restructuring of the repayment plan for your investment(s) and/or, in Nemabollon's sole discretion, any extension of the length of the term of your investment(s) in order to increase the chances that your investment(s) will be repaid in whole or in part. In cases where a investment is in default, and subject to the distribution timing provisions noted in Section 1.3  investment Collection and Repayment) above, each applicable Lender will have the option to recover a portion of whatever principal has been repaid up to that point.
</p>

<p>
Basically, Nemabollon has guidelines for when to declare a investment in default (meaning we believe the investment is not going to be repaid). We may decide it’s better not to follow these guidelines in some cases. For instance, while we won’t change a investment’s repayment terms on the Nemabollon website, we may nevertheless allow a borrower or Field Partner more time to repay if we think it will help you get your money back.
</p>

<p>
For Partner investments made in local currencies other than the U.S. dollar, Nemabollon gives Field Partners the option to have Lenders share the risk of principal losses resulting from currency exchange rate fluctuations. Field Partners may require Lenders to bear any losses due to the appreciation of the U.S. dollar by over 10% relative to the local currency in which the investment was made. The investment profile for each Partner investment on the Website specifies whether the applicable Field Partner will cover all losses from currency fluctuations, or whether Lenders will be required to share the risk of currency exchange rate losses.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
In addition to investment defaults, you may lose money because of changing currency exchange rates. Nemabollon investments are made in U.S. dollars, but Field Partners often distribute the money to borrowers in their local currency. Sometimes local currency becomes less valuable during the term of a investment. This means that by the time a borrower repays his or her investment, it might equal less than the original investment amount when it’s converted back to U.S. dollars. Field Partners have to make up for some of the difference, but not above 10%. The rest of the loss is passed along to contributing lenders.
</p>

<p>
If for any reason less than 100% of your investment is repaid, you agree that neither Nemabollon nor its Field Partners or Trustees (as well as any "related Field Partner or Trustee entity" – for example, one that as part of a restructuring or otherwise, assumes control over such a Field Partner or Trustee, its assets and/or its obligations) shall have any liability therefor, and you hereby release and forever hold harmless Nemabollon, its Field Partners, its Trustees and any "related Field Partner or Trustee entity" for any loss you may incur. You should consult with your accountant and/or tax advisors to determine the appropriate tax treatment of such a loss.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
If any part of your investment is not repaid, you will lose that money. You won’t sue Nemabollon, Field Partners, Trustees, or anyone else for your losses.
</p>

<p>
1.5       Insufficient Lender Funds. In the event that you make a investment and your payment does not clear (e.g., an eCheck does not validly deliver to Nemabollon the full amount of the intended investment, or your payment provider reverses a payment originally intended for Nemabollon), you agree that Nemabollon may, in its sole discretion, (i) offset the amount of the insufficiently funded investment against your Nemabollon Credit if your account contains it, or (ii) if you do not deposit Nemabollon Credit sufficient to cover the shortfall, close your Nemabollon account.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
If you try to make a investment and your payment doesn’t clear, we can cover the investment with Nemabollon credit from your account (if you have any), or close your account if you do not deposit the necessary credit.
</p>

<p>
1.6       Tax Deductibility. You understand that Nemabollon is a non-profit public benefit corporation. Nemabollon has received exemption with the Internal Revenue Service as an organization that qualifies as a public charity under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. Funds you donate to Nemabollon’s operations are eligible for tax deductibility in the United States. You acknowledge, however, that making a investment on the Website does not constitute a charitable donation, and therefore you are not eligible to receive a tax deduction for any funds lent to a Borrower through the Website. You also understand that you are solely responsible for determining the proper tax treatment for any investment you make through the Website and the Program. Nemabollon has not and will not provide any tax or legal advice to you in connection with any investment you might make. This Agreement does not attempt to define the tax implications of participating in the Program. If you participate in the Program, you should consult with your own accountants, tax advisors and legal advisors.
</p>

<p>
Basically, Nemabollon is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit that runs on donations. If you donate money to Nemabollon in addition to your investments, the donations qualify for a tax deduction in the U.S. However, if you make a investment through Nemabollon, it isn’t considered a donation to Nemabollon and isn’t tax deductible.
</p>

<p>
We can’t give you specific tax advice.
</p>

<p>

1.7       investment Records. Records of each investment you make (including this Agreement and any repayment history) are kept by Nemabollon and, if you have a registered account with Nemabollon and upon your written request, will be made available to you at any time throughout the term of the investment. Your Nemabollon Credit balance can also be accessed via your Nemabollon account.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
You can check your lending history and account balance by signing into your Nemabollon account, or by writing to Nemabollon to ask for it.
</p>

<p>
1.8       User Account Inactivity; Instructions for Auto-Donation of Funds to Nemabollon or Auto-Withdrawal Return of Funds to User; Potential Escheatment of Funds. Nemabollon welcomes its Users' active participation in the Nemabollon Program. However, there may be occasions when a User becomes "inactive" for an extended period of time – i.e., a User does not log in to his or her Nemabollon account (or otherwise indicate to Nemabollon a desire to keep the account active – for example, through a phone or email communication with Nemabollon or by taking advantage of embedded response features, such as a click-response button in an email or other electronic communication from Nemabollon) or there are no credits/withdrawals made to such User's account. Therefore, Nemabollon has implemented a Website feature pursuant to which you may instruct Nemabollon in advance as to how you wish any remaining balances in your account to be handled in the event your account were to become inactive for a period of 24 or more consecutive months – namely, whether in such a case of User inactivity, you (i) wish to automatically donate remaining funds in your account to Nemabollon's general operating expenses to further Nemabollon's philanthropic mission or (ii) wish for Nemabollon to return remaining funds in your account to you via Nemabollon's standard account withdrawal process. In addition, in such cases of User inactivity, Nemabollon may elect to automatically terminate the inactive User account.
</p>

<p>
For Users who either (i) joined Nemabollon prior to 12:00PM on June 14, 2010 or (ii) joined Nemabollon through the Nemabollon Zip website (formerly hosted at zip Nemabollon.org) and accepted the Nemabollon Zip Terms of Use, but did not make a Partner investment or otherwise accept the Nemabollon.org Terms of Use prior to June 1, 2016: if you wish to take advantage of this feature, you must first affirmatively instruct Nemabollon by opting in to one of the two choices (i.e., auto-donation to Nemabollon or auto-withdrawal return to User).
</p>

<p>
For all other Users: you will upon registration on the Website automatically be opted-in to instructing Nemabollon to auto-convert any remaining account balances as a donation to Nemabollon's general operating expenses to further Nemabollon's philanthropic mission if your account becomes inactive for a period of 24 or more consecutive months. Please note that you are free to change this pre-set option in your discretion and at any time in advance (although you understand any funds that have been auto-donated based on the then-existing preference setting shall not be revocable once the auto-donation has taken place).
</p>

<p>
Basically,
If your Nemabollon account has no activity for 2 years, it will become inactive and we reserve the right to close it. You can go to your account settings to let us know ahead of time what we should do with the money in your account if this happens. By default, your account balance will be donated to Nemabollon if your account becomes inactive. If you don’t want that to occur, you can change your settings to instruct Nemabollon to return your inactive funds to your PayPal account. Depending on when and how you signed up for Nemabollon, you may not have a default setting. If this is the case, you can go to your account settings and choose to either donate inactive funds to Nemabollon or have them returned to you.
</p>

<p>
In the event that your account shows no activity for an extended period of time and (i) you have not indicated an instruction to Nemabollon through an inactivity preference selection described above or (ii) your instructions to have remaining balances returned to you cannot be successfully completed, whether due to invalid/incomplete information, your failure to claim the funds after thirty (30) calendar days have passed from the day Nemabollon has forwarded the funds to you, a return of funds back to Nemabollon as unclaimed after Nemabollon has attempted to forward your funds to you, or for any other reason internal or external to Nemabollon, then Nemabollon may determine it is appropriate to forward (i.e., escheat) the balance remaining in your inactive Nemabollon account to the state government of your state of residency. In such a case, Nemabollon will determine your residency based on the state listed in your mailing address information that may have previously been made available to us. If your address is unknown or is outside of the USA, Nemabollon may then find it is appropriate to forward (escheat) your funds to the State of California. If your funds are escheated to a state authority, you would have to contact the relevant state's unclaimed property administrator to reclaim such funds.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
If your account becomes inactive without instructions for what to do with your money, we may send it to your home state government so that you can claim it later. We may also do this if you’ve told us to return the funds to your PayPal account, but we can’t for some reason (for example, if you haven’t given us a correct PayPal account). If you live outside the U.S., or if we don’t know where you live, we will send the money to the State of California.
</p>

<p>
2. Additional Website Features
2.1      Auto-lending. Without in any way limiting any provisions of Section 1 of this Agreement, Nemabollon may implement Website features pursuant to which a Lender may – in lieu of manually accessing his or her registered account to specify a investment or investments to make – establish account settings to automatically make investments based on the Lender’s prior instructions and without further direct input from the Lender, based on Lender-selected preferences, the amount of Nemabollon Credit available in the Lender's account, and other business factors, such as the availability of investments on the Website and other parameters as may be determined by Nemabollon in its sole discretion. To the extent a Lender chooses to activate the auto-lending feature on the Lender's registered account (whether by manually changing settings by logging into a Lender’s account, activating auto-lending via more automated tools that Nemabollon may offer from time to time such as via email or other electronic communications, or by otherwise contacting Nemabollon), and depending on the particular preferences selected by the Lender, any and all available Nemabollon Credit at any time in such Lender's account (including, but not limited to, repayments on previously made investments or new Nemabollon Credit otherwise deposited into the Lender's account) may be subject to being automatically deployed under the auto-lending program. You understand and acknowledge, however, that a Lender's activation of the auto-lending choice on such Lender's account does not necessarily guarantee that investments will be successfully made. Variables such as a Lender's particular set of auto-lending preferences, or the general availability of investments not already funded through manual selection by other Nemabollon Lenders, or other feature parameters as established by Nemabollon in its sole discretion, may impact the chances of an automatic investment being made. You further acknowledge and agree that any investments transacted under the auto-lending feature are in all respects investments voluntarily made by you as the Lender, based on your instructions as reflected in your preference settings simply executed by the Nemabollon system and subject to overall availability of investments and other feature parameters, and are under no circumstances to be considered to be investments chosen by Nemabollon on such Lender's behalf. Furthermore, in no event will a investment made pursuant to the auto-lending feature, by a Lender who has chosen to activate the auto-lending feature, be cancellable or refundable by the Lender. You agree that Nemabollon and its Field Partners shall have no liability if for any reason less than 100% of a investment made pursuant to auto-lending is repaid, and you hereby release and forever hold harmless Nemabollon and its Field Partners for any loss you may incur from an auto-lending investment. Nemabollon may modify or terminate the auto-lending functionality at any time or from time to time.
</p>

<p>
Basically, Nemabollon gives lenders the option to have their Nemabollon credit automatically lent and re-lent according to criteria they set in advance. Nemabollon isn’t liable for any money you lose on investments made using this feature, and auto investments cannot be canceled.

The maker of a Dedicated investment will not receive – and will not be entitled to – any repayments made (if any) or any other reimbursement or consideration for the Dedicated investment.

In such cases, a User understands and agrees that (i) the recommendation made by selecting a investment to be supported with DAF Funds (whether via free trial investments, Bonuses, or other features that Nemabollon may offer from time to time) is advisory in nature only and that final discretion in the deployment of any DAF Funds ultimately rests with Nemabollon by law and (ii) such a User shall not exercise advisory privileges to satisfy a personal pledge or obligation or in a manner which results in any impermissible private benefit to the User, the funding donor of the applicable DAF Funds, or any of such funder’s affiliates.

<p>
THE WEBSITE AND PROGRAM, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY CONTENT OR INFORMATION CONTAINED WITHIN IT (INCLUDING THIRD PARTY DATA PROVIDED TO Nemabollon) OR ANY SERVICE OR ADVICE PROVIDED IN CONNECTION WITH THE PROGRAM, IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITH NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

</p>

<p>
Basically,
While we strive for correct information on the Nemabollon website, we don’t double check the accuracy of everything posted on our website, including investments posted by Field Partners.

</p>

<p>
6. Governing Law; Resolution of Disputes; Arbitration and Waivers
This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to its choice of law or conflict of law provisions. If any dispute arises between you and Nemabollon, including, without limitation, any dispute arising from or relating to the Website or the Program, you agree that all such disputes will be determined exclusively by final and binding arbitration, in accordance with the then existing commercial rules of the American Arbitration Association in San Francisco if the amount claimed is greater than $100 and otherwise over the telephone or in another city in which Nemabollon is located. The arbitration shall be heard and adjudicated by one arbitrator to be selected by you and Nemabollon. Any award will be final, binding and conclusive upon the parties, subject only to judicial review provided by Michigan statute, and a judgment rendered on the arbitration award can be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either you or Nemabollon may seek any injunctive relief in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, as may be necessary to preserve rights pending the completion of arbitration and Nemabollon may seek any injunctive relief in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California, or another court of competent jurisdiction, at any time against any violations of Section 3 (Acceptable Use) or Section 4 (Proprietary Rights) of this Agreement.
</p>

<p>
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, BY AGREEING TO SUBMIT ALL DISPUTES TO BINDING ARBITRATION, YOU AND Nemabollon HEREBY WAIVE YOUR RIGHT TO A JURY OR COURT TRIAL OF ANY CLAIM OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY CONTEMPLATED USE HEREIN, INCLUDING CONTRACT, TORT, BREACH OF DUTY AND ALL OTHER CLAIMS, EXCEPT AS SPECIFICALLY PROVIDED ABOVE.
</p>

<p>
You waive, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right you may have to claim or recover, in any legal action or proceeding, any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
If you have a dispute with Nemabollon, you agree to solve it through arbitration instead of a lawsuit. This means an independent person whose job it is to solve disputes will make a binding decision. In other words, you’re giving up your right to a jury or court trial and you agree to be subject to Michigan law, no matter where you live.
</p>

<p>
7. Indemnity
You agree to indemnify and hold Nemabollon harmless from any loss, liability, claim, or demand, including reasonable attorney's fees, made or incurred by any third party due to or arising (directly or indirectly) out of your use of the Website or participation in the Program or arising from your breach of this Agreement.

Nemabollon may also terminate your participation in the Program and registered account at any time and for any reason, effective upon transmission of notice to you at the email address you provide to Nemabollon. Upon such a Nemabollon-initiated termination, your available Nemabollon Credit shall be returned to you within thirty (30) days of account termination and any Nemabollon Credit you may receive in the future shall also be returned to you in due course. If your participation in the Program and registered account is terminated by Nemabollon, you agree not to access or use the Website or participate in the Program. If you violate this Agreement or if your participation in the Program or registered account is terminated, Nemabollon has the right to delete your profile and remove your User Generated Content.
</p>

<p>
Basically,
You agree to these terms both during your use of Nemabollon and after you close your account. If you want to close your account, you should let us know where to send your money (as well as any future investment repayments).
