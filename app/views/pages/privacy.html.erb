<div class="terms-content">
	
<p>
	This Privacy Policy describes how Nemabollon collects and uses the personal information you provide to Nemabollon through our Website (https://nemabollon.herokuapp.com/) or by other means. It also describes the choices available to you regarding our use of your personal information and how you can access and update this information. By accessing or using the Website, you signify that you have read this Privacy Policy, and you expressly consent to our collection, use, disclosure, storage and protection of your personal information as described in this Privacy Policy.
</p>

<p>
1.    No sale of personal information.  Nemabollon will not rent or sell your personal information to third parties.
</p>

<p>
2.    Information you provide through the account creation and update process.  When you create an account on the Website, we collect basic information about you through the registration process – your name, email address, and a means to authenticate your account (for example, a password). You may also choose to provide additional information through the account creation and update process, such as the person who referred you to Nemabollon, your location (for example, city, state/province and country), a picture and your address. If you choose to access the Website through your Facebook account, you are creating an account with Nemabollon on the Website and you grant Nemabollon permission to access your basic Facebook information (including gender and birthday) and, with your express consent, to use other information about you from Facebook in accordance with the Facebook terms of use, our Terms of Use and this Privacy Policy. Services like Facebook Connect give you the option to post information about your activities on this Website to your profile page to share with others within your network. You can review and update the account information you provide to Nemabollon through the Website by logging into your account on the Website. We collect any additional information you choose to provide us when you update your account on the Website.
</p>

<p>

3.    Information displayed on your lender page.  When you register for an account on the Website, the default profile setting is to have a public lender profile on the Website and under this setting, a basic public lender page will automatically be created for you. The basic public lender page shows to the public your first name, area of residence (city, state/province and country), public lender page URL and the date on which you created an account on the Website.  If you have performed work for Nemabollon, information related to this work may be automatically included on your basic public lender page (for example, if you have been a Nemabollon fellow, your Nemabollon fellow blog posts). You may also choose to provide other information through the creation of a lender page (for example, your occupation, the reasons why you lend, a description of your work and your website). You can review and update the lender page information you provide to Nemabollon through the Website by logging into your account on the Website. You have the option of closing down your public lender profile on the Website by changing your lender page setting to anonymous at your discretion. If you have a public lender profile, once you begin to make Investments on the Website or utilize other features on the Website, your public lender page on the Website will automatically show information about your activity on the Website (as further described below). 

</p>

<p>
4.    Information collected and displayed about the Investments that you have made.  Nemabollon collects information on your Investments, individually  and in the aggregate (for example, number of Investments and the distribution of Investments by gender, country, sector and partner). If you have created an account on the Website and conducted Investments through your account, Nemabollon makes information on these Investments available to you on your private portfolio page on the Website. Except as noted in Section 10 below, Nemabollon will not disclose your personally identifiable Investment information to any third party without your consent (please note: having a public lender profile setting on the Website at the time of disclosure is considered consent for such disclosure). If you have a public lender profile, information on Investments conducted through your Account will be displayed on your public lender page. Nemabollon may further publicly display and disclose Loan Transaction information, either in a personally identifiable or anonymous manner (depending on your lender profile setting at the time of such display or disclosure), for example, as part of the latest activity of any Lending Team to which you may have attributed the Loan, as part of the current activity on the Website and as part of a historical visualization of activity on the Website. If you have created an account on the Website and conducted Investments through your account, you can review information for these Investments by logging into your account on the Website.
</p>

<p>

5.    Information collected, displayed and used for other Website and Program features.  As you use additional features on the Website or otherwise participate in the Program, we may collect any additional information you choose to provide in order to facilitate the operation of these features on the Website or your participation in the Program. For example:

</p>

<p>

a.    Lending Teams.  If you join a Lending Team and you have a public lender profile, information about your Lending Team will be displayed on your public lender page (for example, Lending Team name and location, as well as the number of Investments made by the Lending Team). In turn, you will be displayed as a member of the Lending Team (and a captain of the Lending Team, if applicable) either in a personally identifiable or anonymous manner (depending on your lender profile setting). Information about the Investments that you have attributed to a Lending Team (individually and in the aggregate) also will be displayed as part of Investments made by that Lending Team. You can review your Lending Team information by logging into your account on the Website.

</p>

<p>
b.    Invitees.  The lending profile of persons who have accepted your invitations to create an account on the Website may be displayed on your lending page as accepted invitees. In turn, if you have accepted an invitation to create an account on the Website, your lending profile may be displayed as an accepted invitee on the lending page of the person who invited you. If you have created an account on the Website and invited persons using the Nemabollon invitation feature in your account, you can review your invite activity and your accepted invitee information by logging into your account on the Website.
</p>

<p>


c.    Nemabollon Cards.  If you purchase a Nemabollon Card gift product, we collect information about your purchase (for example, your name as purchaser, amount you spent, number of Nemabollon Cards purchased and purchase dates) and information about your recipient that you provide (for example, recipient name, email address and physical address). Nemabollon uses the information you provide in order to deliver the Nemabollon Card and contact the purchaser and/or the recipient with respect to the purchased items. We may automatically disclose to the purchaser of an electronic Nemabollon Card the redeeming lender profile and date of redemption of the electronic Nemabollon Card. If you have created an account on the Website and purchased Nemabollon Cards through your account, you can review your Nemabollon Card information by logging into your account on the Website.

If you use interactive features on the Website to write a comment (for example, on a Nemabollon blog, message board or volunteer forum), Nemabollon will collect your name and your comment, and optionally, your location and Nemabollon may publicly display this information. If you use interactive features on the Website to write a message through Nemabollon’s lender messaging feature, Nemabollon will collect your message and information about your recipient that you provide in order to deliver your message to the recipient and make your message available for access by the recipient. You should be aware that any information you provide in these areas may be read, collected, and used by others who access them. To request removal of your personal information from our blog or community forum, please contact us.  In some cases, we may not be able to remove your personal information, in which case we will let you know if we are unable to do so and why.
</p>

<p>
e.    Integrated third party features.  If you use features on the Website that are integrated with third party websites or services (for example, Twitter and Facebook) to share information about your activity on the Website (for example, information about recently completed Investments and whether you “like” Nemabollon) through the third party website or service, Nemabollon will share this information with the third party website or service and additional information, if any, that you choose to provide to Nemabollon in order to use these features (for example, your username for the third party website or service). However, Nemabollon reserves the right to withhold or withdraw information related to borrowers to the extent necessary to protect the privacy of borrowers. If you use interactive features on Nemabollon to indicate that you "recommend" a particular feature or listing on Nemabollon, that information will be collected and may be displayed on the Website and furthermore shared on any applicable third party websites and services to which you have authorized such information sharing.

</p>

<p>

f.    Donations.  Nemabollon collects information on any donations you make to Nemabollon (whether through the Website or offline) to communicate with you (for example, to provide donation confirmations) via your email address, physical address or through other means of contact that you have chosen to provide to Nemabollon.

</p>

<p>
g.    Customer service.  If you contact Nemabollon customer service, we will collect the information you provide (for example, your name, email address, physical address, phone number and question/comment) in order to contact you and address your question or comment.
</p>

<p>

h.    Applications.  If you submit an application to Nemabollon (for example, to be an employee, volunteer, borrower, trustee or field partner), we collect the information you submit (for example, name, phone number, resume, cover letter and position of interest) to assess the application and follow up with you on such submission.  If you are applying to be a Nemabollon fellow, we reserve the right to disclose your application information to our field partners in order to help evaluate your application and placement.

</p>

<p>

i.    Surveys and Promotions. From time-to-time, Nemabollon may provide you the opportunity to participate in promotions or surveys through the Website or through email. If you participate, we may request certain personally identifiable information from you. Participation in these surveys or promotions is completely voluntary and you therefore have a choice whether or not to disclose this information. The requested information typically includes contact information (such as name and shipping address), and demographic information (such as zip code and gender). We use this information to notify and award promotion winners, to monitor Website traffic, personalize the Website and Program and to send participants email newsletters. We may use third party service providers to conduct these surveys or promotions. We will not share the personally identifiable information you provide through a contest or survey with other third parties unless we give you prior notice and choice.

</p>

<p>

j.    Nemabollon API.  The Nemabollon API is a service Nemabollon provides to allow third parties to develop and offer applications, services and features using information from the Website and Program (“Third Party Applications”).  The Nemabollon API may share any information about you that you have chosen to share publicly on the Website (whether through your lender page settings or otherwise) (“Public Information”).  In addition, if you authorize a Third Party Application to use your non-public information from the Website or Program (for example, your contact information and the amount of your available Nemabollon Credit and outstanding Funds) (“Non-Public Information”), you are giving Nemabollon permission to share your Non-Public Information to such Third Party Application.  Third Party Applications are not created or maintained by Nemabollon, but by third parties.  These third parties’ terms of service and privacy policies govern how your information is handled by them (whether you provide your information to these third parties directly or through the Nemabollon API) and not this Privacy Policy or the Nemabollon Terms of Use.  These third parties have agreed to the Nemabollon API Terms of Service or a separately negotiated agreement, which contain restrictions on the use of your information.  Despite these agreements, Nemabollon may not screen or audit any Third Party Application, and Nemabollon cannot guarantee that third parties will abide by these agreements.  Nemabollon gives no guarantees or warranties with respect to any Third Party Application and is not responsible for your use or inability to use any Third Party Application, including without limitation the content, accuracy, reliability or security of Third Party Applications or the privacy practices or other policies of third parties.  To revoke permissions that you have granted to a Third Party Application, you may revoke these permissions by logging into your account on the Website or by contacting Nemabollon. To report suspected misuse of information, please contact us.
</p>

<p>
6.    Information from third parties.  Nemabollon collects your information from third parties to facilitate activities and transactions for the operation of the Website and Program, improve User experiences on the Website and in the Program and further Nemabollon’s mission.  Examples of information we receive from other sources include information from another User about whether you referred that User to Nemabollon, information from service providers about your use of the Website.  If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend’s name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Nemabollon stores this information for the sole purpose of sending this one-time email, offering the ability for you to easily remind your friend and tracking the success of our referral program. Your friend may contact us at contactus Nemabollon.org to request that we remove this information from our database. You can import contacts from your Gmail, Yahoo! or other email account address book to invite them to become members of our site. We or our service providers collect the username and password for the email account from which you wish to import your contacts and we will only use it for that purpose.

7.    Information from cookies and web beacons.  Cookies are small text files created by a website that store information on your computer, such as your preferences when visiting that website. Similar to many websites, if you have enabled cookies in your browser, Nemabollon, independently and through enabled third party tools and programs, collects certain technical information using cookies, such as the path of users to the Website, pages visited, originating IP address, browser type, browser language and the date and time of the user's visit. This information helps Nemabollon track trends and improve areas of the Website and Program, and are common analytics used by most websites. If you have disabled cookies, the Website may not work as it is intended because Nemabollon uses cookies when you sign in to keep track of your personal session. Web beacons are tiny graphics with a unique identifier that are similar in function to cookies but, instead of being stored on your computer, are embedded invisibly on web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence. Web beacons are used to track the online movements of internet users. Nemabollon uses them to better understand User interaction and engagement with the Website and Program (including without limitation, in electronic Communications), such as by learning whether certain users have accessed the Website via links from other websites. Nemabollon can use this information to tailor its audience for advertisements promoting Nemabollon. You may set your browser preferences to opt out of the collection and use of this tracking information for ad targeting purposes. One way to set your preferences for what sites can or can't share tracking information with Nemabollon (or with other websites) is by using a service such as the one available at www.aboutads.info/choices.  Nemabollon also uses cookies for remarketing, by placing a cookie in your browser to signal that you've visited the Website.  This gives us the option to show you ads for Nemabollon when you visit other websites that host advertisements.  Nemabollon supports the Do Not Track preference available on most internet browsers.  When you have enabled the Do Not Track setting on your browser, Nemabollon's remarketing functionality will be disabled.  The use of cookies by third parties on the Website is for the purpose of making the Website easier to use and to enable certain features of the Website and is not covered by this Privacy Policy.
